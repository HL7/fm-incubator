# fm-incubator-ig

New features that are being prepared for addition to the FHIR standard when they are mature.

### IG installation 

In order to build the IG, please ensure you have the following installed:
- 64 Bit JVM - at minimum Java 17
- The latest stable versions of Ruby and Jekyll
- Git
- SUSHI (https://fshschool.org/docs/sushi/installation/)
- Clone the [repository](https://github.com/HL7/fhir-symptoms-ig). 

### Initial run (Windows)

- To install SUSHI, run 'sushi init'
- To install the guide, run _updatePublisher.bat and type 'Y' in response to both prompts. This will install the publisher and enable building.
- To build the guide, run _genonce.bat, either in a command window or by double-clicking the file

- (i don't actually know how to install and build on MAC)

### Deploying SUSHI alone
